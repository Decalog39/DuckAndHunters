# DuckAndHunters
This is project for II1305.
We have developed a TCG card game where you get to choose a faction between ducks and hunter. 
Each faction has unique card. 
Goal is to defeat opponent by lowering his HP to 0.

You will need unity engine to run this game. 
Download entire repository and open it through unity as a project.
Inside unity, you will be able to build a game and run it by your self.
But beaware that you need second player in order to play game properly.
